</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How can stablecoins help people in countries with money problems?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Imagine if your money kept losing value every day - that's what happens in some countries! <b>Stablecoins</b> are digital money that stays steady, like a dollar.</p>

<p>Here's how they help kids in these countries:</p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Safe piggy bank:</b> When local money gets worth less and less, people can keep their savings in stablecoins</li>
    <li><b>Send anywhere:</b> People can send money to family far away without paying big fees</li>
    <li><b>Always works:</b> You can use them even if banks in your country have problems</li>
</ol>

<p>To keep everyone safe, grown-ups need to make good rules so nobody steals the digital piggy banks!</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>If we made a brand new money system today, how would stablecoins help?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Imagine if we could build a brand new way to use money from scratch, like building with LEGO blocks! Here's what it might look like:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Fast like lightning:</b> Money would move instantly between people, not taking days</li>
    <li><b>Works all the time:</b> No more "sorry, the bank is closed" - it would work day and night</li>
    <li><b>Trust helpers:</b> Special computer programs would make sure nobody steals or cheats</li>
    <li><b>For everyone:</b> Even kids without banks could have a digital piggy bank</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Stablecoins</b> could be the building blocks of this system! They stay steady in value like regular dollars but move around easily like email.</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How would shopping change if we all used stablecoins?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Imagine if stores and customers used <b>stablecoins</b> (digital dollars) instead of credit cards or cash! Here's what would be different:</p>

<ol>
    <li><b>Less money for middlemen:</b> When you buy things with a credit card, the store pays fees to many companies. With stablecoins, they might pay much less!</li>
    <li><b>Shopping anywhere:</b> You could buy things from other countries without paying extra just because it's far away</li>
    <li><b>Safer shopping:</b> Special computer programs could make sure nobody steals from you or the store</li>
    <li><b>Faster money:</b> Stores would get their money right away, not days later</li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest change would be for people who buy things from other countries - it would be as easy as buying from next door!</p></div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-4">Remote Work: How It Affects Jobs and Company Teamwork
</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>Is remote work good or bad for new workers?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Remote work can be tough for beginners!</b> Here's why:

<ol>
<li><b>Missing mentors:</b> Young workers learn by watching experienced people up close</li>
<li><b>No hallway chats:</b> Those quick, unplanned conversations teach a lot</li>
<li><b>Lonely learning:</b> Being alone all day feels like "solitary confinement" for young people</li>
<li><b>Less connections:</b> It's harder to make friends and build relationships</li>
</ol>

Companies found that new workers are much less productive when working from home, while experienced workers often do really well remotely.
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can companies cut unnecessary meetings and extra workers?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Companies get too big and have too many meetings!</b> Here's how to fix it:

<ol>
<li><b>Delete all meetings:</b> Some companies just wiped everyone's calendar clean and started over</li>
<li><b>Ask why:</b> Do you really need 14 committees to make one decision?</li>
<li><b>Look for waste:</b> Most managers can run teams with 10% fewer people</li>
<li><b>Stop using so much software:</b> Too many computer programs make jobs complicated</li>
<li><b>Focus on results:</b> Care about what gets done, not how many meetings you had</li>
</ol>

Remember: Almost every company has departments that could be smaller and still work great!
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>What's the best mix of home and office work?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Different jobs need different work setups!</b> A good mix should:

<ol>
<li><b>Match the job:</b> Engineers can work from home better than new salespeople</li>
<li><b>Help beginners:</b> Young workers need more office time to learn and grow</li>
<li><b>Use offices for teamwork:</b> Come together for brainstorming and big decisions</li>
<li><b>Trust top performers:</b> Let your best workers choose where they work</li>
<li><b>Be flexible:</b> Some companies are fully remote (like Shopify) while others need everyone together</li>
</ol>

There's no perfect answer for everyone! The best companies think about what their workers actually need to succeed, not just what looks good.</div>

</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How are robots and AI changing what the military buys?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Imagine if instead of buying big, expensive toy boats that take years to build, the military could buy small, smart flying toys that work together:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Smart over big:</b> AI and robots mean we might not need as many giant ships and tanks</li>
  <li><b>More for less:</b> A $10,000 drone can destroy a $10 million tank!</li>
  <li><b>Faster to make:</b> New technology can be built quickly, while big ships take 8-10 years</li>
  <li><b>Working together:</b> Lots of small, smart weapons can be better than a few big ones</li>
</ol>

<p>The military needs to look at cool new technology first, then decide what to buy - not the other way around!</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How should America spend on defense when other countries are powerful too?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Imagine if instead of being the only kid with all the toys on the playground, now there are other kids with their own toys. This changes how we play:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Sharing the playground:</b> America might not need to be the only "boss" of the world anymore</li>
  <li><b>Less fighting:</b> If we accept a world where America, China, and Russia all have power, we might not need to spend so much on fighting</li>
  <li><b>Different toys:</b> Instead of building lots of military bases everywhere, we might focus on trading and making friends</li>
  <li><b>New technology:</b> Spending money on smarter weapons instead of just more weapons</li>
</ol>

<p>A peaceful world with multiple powerful countries might mean we don't need such a huge military everywhere!</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can the military work with tech companies to make better stuff?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Think about how the military could team up with cool tech companies like they're making a superhero team:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Let companies be creative:</b> Companies like Anduril and Shield AI are making amazing drone technology faster than old defense companies</li>
  <li><b>Too much paperwork:</b> The military has too many rules and committees that slow down new ideas</li>
  <li><b>Follow the tech:</b> Military spending should happen AFTER seeing what new technology exists, not before</li>
  <li><b>Fix the buying process:</b> Everyone agrees the way the military buys things is very wasteful and slow</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way is to let smart tech companies invent cool things first, then have the military buy and use those things - not tell companies exactly what to make!</p></div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-4">How Science and New Funding Models Can Help Find Cures
</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>How can computer brain models like Evo2 help find cures for diseases?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Computer models like Evo2 are like super-smart detective tools that can read the "instruction book" of life (DNA).</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Reads patterns:</b> They can spot patterns in DNA we can't see with our eyes</li>
<li><b>Makes predictions:</b> They can guess which changes in DNA might cause sickness</li>
<li><b>Saves time:</b> Instead of testing medicines for years, computers can help scientists find solutions faster</li>
<li><b>Helps with tricky diseases:</b> Can help find cures for hard problems like cancer and Alzheimer's that have many causes</li>
</ol>

<p>This means medicine companies might create better treatments more quickly and cheaply!</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Who should pay for risky science research that might take years to work?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>Science needs different ways to get money for big, risky ideas that might take a long time to work.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Rich people helping:</b> When successful people like the Stripe founders give money without expecting it back right away</li>
<li><b>Science freedom:</b> Let scientists follow their curiosity instead of forcing them to work on specific things</li>
<li><b>Less paperwork:</b> Scientists spend too much time (about 40%) just asking for money instead of doing experiments</li>
<li><b>Multiple helpers:</b> Not just depending on one source (like government) but having many different supporters</li>
</ol>

<p>The best way is when scientists can work on bold ideas without worrying about quick results!</p>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Should discoveries that save lives be free for everyone or can inventors make money?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><p>This is like deciding when to share your toys and when to keep them for yourself.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Open sharing:</b> When scientists share their discoveries (like Evo2), more people can use them to solve problems</li>
<li><b>Money helps progress:</b> But scientists and companies need money to keep inventing new things</li>
<li><b>Balance is key:</b> The best approach is finding the middle ground</li>
<li><b>Possible solutions:</b> Let basic discoveries be free for everyone, but allow companies to make money on specific products they create</li>
</ol>

<p>When discoveries can become life-saving medicines, we want to make sure they reach everyone who needs them, while also encouraging more discoveries to happen!</p></div>

    <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 mb-4">Public vs Private Companies: Which Is Better for Business?
</h2>
    <ul class="text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>Besides money, why might a company stay private or go public?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Companies think about these things when deciding:</b>
<ol>
  <li><b>Control:</b> Private companies can make decisions without asking lots of shareholders</li>
  <li><b>Time management:</b> Public company bosses spend lots of time talking to investors instead of running the business</li>
  <li><b>Privacy:</b> Private companies don't have to tell everyone their secrets and plans</li>
  <li><b>Focus:</b> Public companies worry about their stock price going up and down every day</li>
  <li><b>Growth stage:</b> Some businesses work better as private companies until they're really big</li>
</ol>
</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>How can staying private help companies think about the future instead of just tomorrow?
</strong><br />
        <div class="bullet-content"><b>Private companies can think long-term because:</b>
<ol>
  <li><b>No quarterly pressure:</b> They don't have to make Wall Street happy every three months</li>
  <li><b>Patient investors:</b> Private investors often understand big plans take time</li>
  <li><b>Fewer distractions:</b> Leaders can focus on building something great instead of stock prices</li>
  <li><b>Freedom to experiment:</b> They can try new ideas without worrying about short-term failures</li>
  <li><b>Less explaining:</b> They don't need to justify every business decision to thousands of shareholders</li>
</ol>
